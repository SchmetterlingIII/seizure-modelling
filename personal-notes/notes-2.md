## Re-evaluated goal & scope
Having a semi-realistic abstraction of parts of the brain to visualise the emergence and propagation of the hypersynchronisation of neurons in the brain and seeing how the changing of certain parameters influences its spread. As part of this, I would like to do research into what - inherently - hypersynchronisation is and why it is so linked to neuropathologies like Alzheimer's. 

*I intend for this research to be passively ongoing*

- How would I define hypersynchronisation? 
- What parameters would influence its change?
