In looking for hypersynchronisation in the brain (https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/12/3936/5601465) I found one example of the understanding how hypersynchronicity in the brain emerges since it is important for many neuropathologies. Then I saw that there was a link between seizures (epilepsy as well) to dementia (https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/what-link-between-seizures-and-dementia; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9352925/pdf/fneur-13-922535.pdf) it demonstrated a further necessity for these tools since having a somewhat unified model for this could interest reseachers into some topic for this.

Notes on Alzheimers:
Amyloid-$\beta$ plaques in the brain cause an E/I imbalance, this causes neurotoxicity and neuronal death (similar to *status epilepticus*) and is a fascinating unifying point - abstracted models may have a top-down view on things that can help with the collaboraton of topics by other researchers.

All research trying to find and model hypersynchronisation in the brain uses this idea as the precursor to Alzheimer's which is quite fascinating: this precedes the development of the stated amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques and the gradual disruption of the neural circuitry.

My "theory" is that, as our cells age, there is an increased susceptibility to this syncrhonisation since the mechanism to recognise localised triggers are weakened? Or maybe there is always a likelihood of this occurring but in healthy neurons, this can be regulated easier and the probability is much lower. I need to find sources on this idea and try to link this to the model (and what stage of it this shoudl be integrated within)
